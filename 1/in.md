## About me

Background and strong interest in computer science, mathematics, machine learning, and physics. I co-founded the transdisciplinary startup STRUQT (a part of the EU Agency for the Space Programme ecosystem, Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub, and European AI Startup Landscape). 

Throughout my career, I had an opportunity to work on or lead projects for Unilever, European Commission, MTV, Discovery Channel, Mercedes-Benz, Société Générale, Volkswagen, Shiseido... In addition, I have produced and published 40+ online game titles and 14 mobile apps. I am a member of Mensa and the MIT Technology Review Global Panel.
